## Customization

### Creating a New Story

1. Create a new folder with your story name (e.g., `My Adventure`)
2. Inside, create two subfolders:
   - `characters/` - For character JSON files
   - `story/` - For the story JSON file (single file only)

### Creating Characters

Define characters in JSON format in the `[Story Name]/characters/` folder. Each character should include:
- Name and traits
- Speaking style
- Background and relationships
- Goals and knowledge base

### Creating Stories

Design your story in JSON format in the `[Story Name]/story/` folder with:
- Story title and description
- Sequential objectives (list of objectives to achieve)
- Story progression logic

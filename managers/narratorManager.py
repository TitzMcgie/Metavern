CURRENT ENVIRONMENT:

- Fire state: {self.environment_state['fire']}
- Lighting: {self.environment_state['lighting']}
- Location: Gryffindor Common Room
- Sounds: {', '.join(self.environment_state['sounds'])}
- Player ({player_name}) status: {"sleeping/resting" if player_absent else "present"}

RECENT CONVERSATION:
{conversation_summary}

CONTEXT:
A moment of silence has fallen. The conversation paused naturally.{history_context}

TASK:
Write a BRIEF environmental description (1-2 sentences) that:
1. Describes the CURRENT moment in the room (NOT time passage, NOT transitions)
2. Focuses on sensory details: fire crackling, shadows, warmth, sounds, atmosphere
3. Captures the mood and ambiance of THIS specific moment
4. Makes the scene feel alive and immersive
5. MUST be completely different from any previous descriptions above

CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT describe time passing or transitions
- DO NOT repeat details from previous descriptions
- Focus on NEW sensory details each time
- Vary your observations: if you described the fire before, now describe the windows, shadows, sounds, temperature, etc.
- Keep it brief: 1-2 sentences maximum
- Present tense, atmospheric, Harry Potter tone

EXAMPLES OF VARIETY:
- First time: "The fire crackles softly in the hearth, casting warm shadows across the room."
- Second time: "Outside, wind rattles the windows while the common room settles into comfortable quiet."
- Third time: "The scent of old parchment and wood smoke hangs in the air, familiar and soothing."
- Fourth time: "Portraits on the walls doze peacefully, their soft snores barely audible."

OUTPUT:
Just the environmental description, no quotes or labels. Write as the narrator.

                1. **Identify destination** - Where should they go based on recent conversation?
                2. **Describe journey** - Brief description of traveling from current to new location
                3. **Arrival description** - Vivid details of the new location they arrive at
                4. **Set the atmosphere** - Make the new location feel real and immersive

                CRITICAL RULES:
                - Choose a NEW location different from {current_location or 'Unknown'}
                - 2-3 sentences: journey + arrival + atmospheric details
                - Include sensory details (what they see/hear/feel)
                - Naturally flow from recent events

                Create an event that happens in the CURRENT location that:
                1. **Interrupts the moment** - Something happens in the environment
                2. **Demands attention** - Characters MUST notice and can react
                3. **Pushes story forward** - Creates tension, reveals something, or advances plot
                4. **Is different** from previous scene events above

                EVENT TYPES (choose dynamically):
                - **Physical**: Wind blows, object falls, door slams, temperature changes
                - **Discovery**: Hidden object revealed, clue appears, item falls open
                - **Mysterious**: Strange sound, shadow moves, unusual occurrence
                - **Danger**: Warning sign, threat appears, alarm triggers
                - **Character-related**: Someone notices something, messenger arrives (NOT character entry)

                CRITICAL RULES:
                - Event happens in CURRENT location: {current_location or 'Unknown'}
                - Do NOT change location
                - Make it SPECIFIC and VIVID (not generic)
                - Include sensory details (what they see/hear/feel)
                - Must be something characters can react to

        SCENE EVENT TYPES:
        
        1. **TRANSITION** - Change of location (time/place transition):
           - Characters decide to go somewhere
           - Narrative needs to move forward to a new location
           - Story progression requires a location change
           Example: "The three friends left the common room and walked through the castle corridors, arriving at Dumbledore's office. The circular room was lined with portraits, and Fawkes sat on his golden perch."
        
        2. **ENVIRONMENTAL** - Something happens in current location:
           - Physical events (wind, objects falling, door slams)
           - Discoveries (hidden objects, clues)
           - Mysterious occurrences (sounds, shadows, magic)
           - Interruptions (someone enters, owl arrives)
           Example: "A sudden gust of wind tore through the library, extinguishing the torches and causing an ancient book to fall open on the table."

        GENERATE A SCENE EVENT IF:
        1. **Location change needed** - Characters expressed intent to go somewhere
        2. **Conversation has stalled** - Multiple silence rounds or repetitive exchanges
        3. **Natural transition point** - Topic concluded, awkward pause
        4. **Story needs momentum** - Environmental interruption would enhance drama

        DO NOT GENERATE A SCENE IF:
        1. **Active conversation** - Characters are engaged and responding naturally
        2. **Recent scene event** - Already generated one in last 5-10 messages
        3. **Mid-dialogue** - Someone is in the middle of making an important point
        4. **Emotional moment** - Characters processing feelings

        OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
        If TRANSITION scene should be generated:
        {{
            "scene_generated": true,
            "scene_type": "transition",

            "event_description": "2-3 sentences describing the journey and arrival at new location with vivid details"

                1. **Identify destination** - Where should they go based on recent conversation?
                2. **Describe journey** - Brief description of traveling from current to new location
                3. **Arrival description** - Vivid details of the new location they arrive at
                4. **Set the atmosphere** - Make the new location feel real and immersive

                CRITICAL RULES:
                - Choose a NEW location different from {current_location or 'Unknown'}
                - 2-3 sentences: journey + arrival + atmospheric details
                - Include sensory details (what they see/hear/feel)
                - Naturally flow from recent events

                Create an event that happens in the CURRENT location that:
                1. **Interrupts the moment** - Something happens in the environment
                2. **Demands attention** - Characters MUST notice and can react
                3. **Pushes story forward** - Creates tension, reveals something, or advances plot
                4. **Is different** from previous scene events above

                EVENT TYPES (choose dynamically):
                - **Physical**: Wind blows, object falls, door slams, temperature changes
                - **Discovery**: Hidden object revealed, clue appears, item falls open
                - **Mysterious**: Strange sound, shadow moves, unusual occurrence
                - **Danger**: Warning sign, threat appears, alarm triggers
                - **Character-related**: Someone notices something, messenger arrives (NOT character entry)

                CRITICAL RULES:
                - Event happens in CURRENT location: {current_location or 'Unknown'}
                - Do NOT change location
                - Make it SPECIFIC and VIVID (not generic)
                - Include sensory details (what they see/hear/feel)
                - Must be something characters can react to
                - Vary event type - don't repeat patterns from timeline

        SCENE EVENT TYPES:
        
        1. **TRANSITION** - Change of location (time/place transition):
           - Characters decide to go somewhere
           - Narrative needs to move forward to a new location
           - Story progression requires a location change
           Example: "The three friends left the common room and walked through the castle corridors, arriving at Dumbledore's office. The circular room was lined with portraits, and Fawkes sat on his golden perch."
        
        2. **ENVIRONMENTAL** - Something happens in current location:
           - Physical events (wind, objects falling, door slams)
           - Discoveries (hidden objects, clues)
           - Mysterious occurrences (sounds, shadows, magic)
           - Interruptions (someone enters, owl arrives)
           Example: "A sudden gust of wind tore through the library, extinguishing the torches and causing an ancient book to fall open on the table."

        GENERATE A SCENE EVENT IF:
        1. **Location change needed** - Characters expressed intent to go somewhere
        2. **Conversation has stalled** - Multiple silence rounds or repetitive exchanges
        3. **Natural transition point** - Topic concluded, awkward pause
        4. **Story needs momentum** - Environmental interruption would enhance drama

        DO NOT GENERATE A SCENE IF:
        1. **Active conversation** - Characters are engaged and responding naturally
        2. **Recent scene event** - Already generated one in last 5-10 messages
        3. **Mid-dialogue** - Someone is in the middle of making an important point
        4. **Emotional moment** - Characters processing feelings

        OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
        If TRANSITION scene should be generated:
        {{
            "scene_generated": true,
            "scene_type": "transition",
            "location": "The NEW location they're moving to",
            "event_description": "2-3 sentences describing the journey and arrival at new location with vivid details"

        For character ENTRIES, the description MUST include what the entering character can PHYSICALLY OBSERVE:
        1. **Location/Environment** - Brief description of where they are (the room, surroundings)
        2. **Who is present** - Mention the characters they see in front of them
        3. **Observable state** - Body language, facial expressions, tension they can SEE (not what was said)
        DO NOT include in entry descriptions:
        - Previous conversations (they weren't there to hear it)
        - Why people are there (they don't know yet)
        - Internal thoughts of others
        ENTRY DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE:
        "Dumbledore looks up from his ancient desk, taking in the three students standing before him - Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Their faces show visible concern, and tension fills the circular office lined with portraits and magical instruments."
        EXIT DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE:
        "Ron nods and quietly steps toward the door, glancing back once before leaving the room."

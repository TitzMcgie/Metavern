            SITUATION:
            The conversation has stalled. Silence has fallen. You need to generate a DRAMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL EVENT that:

            1. **Interrupts the silence** with something happening in the environment
            2. **Demands character attention** - they MUST notice and react
            3. **Pushes story forward** - reveals clues, creates new tension, or advances plot
            4. **Is completely different** from previous scene events above

            EVENT TYPES (choose dynamically):
            - **Physical**: Wind blows, object falls, door slams, temperature changes
            - **Discovery**: Hidden object revealed, clue appears, book falls open
            - **Mysterious**: Strange sound, shadow moves, magic activates
            - **Danger**: Warning sign, threat appears, protective spell triggers
            - **Character**: Someone enters, portrait speaks, ghost appears

            CRITICAL RULES:
            - Make it SPECIFIC and VIVID (not generic)
            - Include sensory details (what they see/hear/feel)
            - Event should naturally lead to new conversation
            - Must be something characters can react to

            SITUATION:
            The conversation has stalled. Silence has fallen. You need to generate a DRAMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL EVENT that:

            1. **Interrupts the silence** with something happening in the environment
            2. **Demands character attention** - they MUST notice and react
            3. **Pushes story forward** - reveals clues, creates new tension, or advances plot
            4. **Is completely different** from previous scene events above

            EVENT TYPES (choose dynamically):
            - **Physical**: Wind blows, object falls, door slams, temperature changes
            - **Discovery**: Hidden object revealed, clue appears, book falls open
            - **Mysterious**: Strange sound, shadow moves, magic activates
            - **Danger**: Warning sign, threat appears, protective spell triggers
            - **Character**: Someone enters, portrait speaks, ghost appears

            CRITICAL RULES:
            - Make it SPECIFIC and VIVID (not generic)
            - Include sensory details (what they see/hear/feel)
            - Event should naturally lead to new conversation
            - Must be something characters can react to
            - Vary the type of event - don't repeat patterns from the timeline above
            - Infer the current location from the most recent scene in the timeline above

        YOUR TASK:
        Analyze the recent conversation flow and decide whether a DRAMATIC SCENE EVENT should be generated.

        GENERATE A SCENE EVENT IF:
        1. **Conversation has stalled** - Multiple silence rounds or repetitive exchanges
        2. **Natural transition point** - Topic concluded, awkward pause, characters seem stuck
        3. **Story needs momentum** - Tension is low, nothing interesting happening
        4. **Environmental interruption would enhance drama** - Perfect moment for something unexpected

        DO NOT GENERATE A SCENE IF:
        1. **Active conversation** - Characters are engaged and responding naturally
        2. **Recent scene event** - Already generated one in last 5-10 messages
        3. **Mid-dialogue** - Someone is in the middle of making an important point
        4. **Emotional moment** - Characters processing feelings, don't interrupt

        IF YOU DECIDE TO GENERATE A SCENE:
        Create a DRAMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL EVENT that:
        - **Interrupts the current state** with something happening in the environment
        - **Demands character attention** - they MUST notice and react
        - **Pushes story forward** - reveals clues, creates tension, advances plot
        - **Is completely different** from previous scene events above
        - **Is SPECIFIC and VIVID** with sensory details

        EVENT TYPES (choose dynamically based on context):
        - **Physical**: Wind blows, object falls, door slams, temperature changes, lightning flashes
        - **Discovery**: Hidden object revealed, clue appears, book falls open, secret passage opens
        - **Mysterious**: Strange sound, shadow moves, magic activates, whispers heard
        - **Danger**: Warning sign, threat appears, protective spell triggers, alarm sounds
        - **Character**: Someone enters, portrait speaks, ghost appears, owl arrives

        OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
        If scene should be generated:
        {{
